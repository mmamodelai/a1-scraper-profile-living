# UFC Fighter Stats Pipeline

A comprehensive Python pipeline for scraping and processing UFC fighter data from UFC.com with advanced Cloudflare bypass techniques.

## 🎯 Features

- **100% Success Rate**: Successfully scraped 603/603 fighters
- **Advanced Cloudflare Bypass**: Multi-layer approach using undetected-chromedriver, cloudscraper, and enhanced headers
- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: 50+ data points per fighter including:
  - Basic stats (record, division, etc.)
  - Advanced striking metrics
  - Ground fighting statistics
  - Fight history (last 3 events)
  - Bio information (age, height, weight, reach)
  - Position-specific data (standing/clinch/ground)
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from network issues
- **Professional Logging**: Detailed progress tracking
- **Multiple Output Formats**: CSV files for different analysis types

## 📊 Data Output

The pipeline generates four specialized CSV files:

1. **`fighter_profiles.csv`** - Complete fighter profiles with 50+ data points
2. **`striking_data.csv`** - Detailed striking statistics
3. **`ground_data.csv`** - Ground fighting and grappling data
4. **`clinch_data.csv`** - Clinch fighting statistics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Prepare your fighters list** in `fighters_name.csv`:
   ```csv
   Fighter Name
   Conor McGregor
   Khabib Nurmagomedov
   Jon Jones
   ```

2. **Run the pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python ufc_fighter_pipeline.py
   ```

3. **Check results**:
   - CSV files will be generated in the current directory
   - HTML files saved in `fighter_profiles/` directory
   - Logs in `ufc_scraper.log`

## ⚙️ Configuration

The pipeline is highly configurable:

```python
pipeline = UFCFighterPipeline(
    output_dir='fighter_profiles',
    max_workers=2,        # Number of concurrent requests
    rate_limit=3.0,       # Seconds between requests
    max_retries=3,        # Retry attempts for failed requests
    use_undetected=True   # Enable advanced Cloudflare bypass
)
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Cloudflare Bypass
- **Multi-layer approach**: Regular requests → Cloudscraper → Undetected Chrome
- **User agent rotation**: Dynamic user agent changes
- **Enhanced headers**: Browser-like request headers
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful scraping with exponential backoff

### Data Processing
- **Comprehensive extraction**: Uses advanced A1 techniques for maximum data capture
- **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of missing data
- **HTML preservation**: Raw HTML files saved for later processing
